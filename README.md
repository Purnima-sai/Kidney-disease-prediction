# Kidney-disease-prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict kidney disease based on patient health data. It aims to assist in early detection by analyzing features like age, blood pressure, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin.

# Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Implementation of models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
- Optional web interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions

Note: This is only testing and training a machine model and not for realtime purposes.
